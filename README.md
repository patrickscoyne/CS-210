# CS-210

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. 

This project is a financial tool written in C++, which allows users to calculate account balances over a specific time based on the initial investment, monthly deposit, and annual interest rate. The application compares the investment specified with one without monthly deposits.

What did you do particularly well? 

This project uses Object-Oriented Programming principles, specifically encapsulation, with the creation of an AccountBalance class. The code is well-structured and uses standard naming conventions, which improves code readability and maintainability.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 

The code could be enhanced by expanding input validation. For example, checking if the user enters a reasonable amount of years would protect against unwanted output.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? 

The "displayTable" function was challenging. The function required the output of doubles into a neat table. I overcame the challenge by converting the doubles to a string using a precision of two and then output them using "setw" and "right" to make them display correctly.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

This project helped me develop skills in object-oriented programming, input validation, and output formatting. The three skills mentioned will be helpful in the majority of future projects.
